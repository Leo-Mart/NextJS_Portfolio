# Portfolio built using NextJS, Tailwind, and MDX-files

This is a small project with the aim to build a portfolio to showcase some of my work and potentially act as a small blog as I navigate the tech-world.

## Tech Stack

The stack uses NextJS which has proven to be really quite nice to work with.

- [**_NextJS_**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**_MDX_**](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [**_Tailwind_**](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [**_Vercel_**](https://vercel.com/)

NextJS lets me create a statically rendered page with relative ease while using MDX to create Markdown files (like this one!) and then read them and convert to HTML which lets me quite easily create new blog posts or project pages.

Tailwind was used to style the project.

Vercel plugs neatly into NextJS which simplifies deploying the project.

## Features

- Static pages for a tidy user experience.
- I'm no designer but I am pretty happy with the styling.

## Inspiration and Help

While I have written all the code myself I took a lot of help and inspiration from a few folks around the web. [Timmy O'Mahony](https://timmyomahony.com/)'s portfolio and accompanying Github rep. This [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-site-with-nextjs-tailwindcss) by Manu Arora and his Github Repo. And this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSi_x29bBmE) by Web Dev Simplified and Hamed Bahram. All of these have been very helpful and a huge shoutout to these folks for sharing their knowledge and code.

## Future Improvements

- FIx some styling for the MDX files.
- Potentially fully responsive design.
- Keep adding new projects and blog posts, maybe use something else to not have to push posts and project-pages to this repo. Git submodules?
- Maybe plug in a proper backend and database at some point, though I see no reason for this at the moment.
