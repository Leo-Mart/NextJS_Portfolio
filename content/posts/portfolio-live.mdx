## The portfolio-page is now live.

This portfolio-page is now fully live and out there(and has been for a few days,by the time I'm writing this post ).
It is hosted on Vercel, which was quite easy to do. Apart from a few issues with my code that came up during building.

There are still a few tweaks that could be done, styling on smaller screens for instance. And probably larger things that could be added or fixed as well. But I am pretty happy with the result so far.

Next up might be to tackle something a bit more challenging. I'm thinking a full-stack e-commerce app built with Java/Spring Boot and React.
