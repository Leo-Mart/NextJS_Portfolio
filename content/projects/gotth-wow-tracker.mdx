A simple web-app for tracking some information about World of Warcraft characters. A user can import their character and see some information about that characters equipped gear, talents, and mythic+ progression.

## Tech Stack

The idea for this app was to learn a new stack that I had gotten a chance to look at during an internship.

- [**_Go_**](https://go.dev/)
- [**_Templ_**](https://templ.guide/)
- [**_Tailwind_**](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [**_HTMX_**](https://htmx.org/)
- [**_MongoDB_**](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Go is used for the backend and server-side rendering. Templ for templating and components. Tailwind for styling and HTMX for interactivity. MongoDB was used to store the information about characters after fetching them using Blizzards API.

The stack seems to work quite well with building small to medium projects that does not require a lot of client-side interactivity and the simplicity of it appeals to me. Also, Go seems like a good middle-point between the "looseness" of Javascript and the strictness of Java or C.

## Features

- **_Easily track character information_**: World of Warcraft is a complex game with many systems, sometimes it can be hard to keep track of all the information so the idea was to collect certain information and present it in a neat way to simplify getting the information that was sought.
- **_Simple and Fast_**: Go is quick and makes loading in the information and presenting it to user quite fast, and the goal was to try to do it with a pretty simple and not overly cluttered UI.

## Challenges

Overall the project was relatively easy, even with my lack of previous experience. A lot of the technologies used are quite simple and intuitive and the documentation is robust.

Working with the Blizzard API was sometimes a bit tedious, if nothing else because of the sheer amount of data they track. Finding and picking out the right information could be a challenge at times.

## Future Improvements

One could most likely keep building this out as much as one would want to. I would like to keep building on it and bring in some more information from the Blizzard API to add in additional features or information to track.

I would like to refactor the code at some point as well, taking into the lesson I learned and applying those to make the code-base cleaner and better structured.
