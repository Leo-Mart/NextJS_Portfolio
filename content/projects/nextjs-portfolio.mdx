A portfolio built for a few reasons:

- **_One:_** to practice programming and build stuff.
- **_Secondly:_** To have a place to showcase my work and maybe occasionally share some reflections about programming, games, art or whatever strikes my fancy.
- **_Thirdly:_** To hopefully aid in the hunt for a job.

Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/Leo-Mart/NextJS_Portfolio)

## Tech Stack

The stack uses NextJS which has proven to be really quite nice to work with.

- [**_NextJS_**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**_MDX_**](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [**_Tailwind_**](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [**_Vercel_**](https://vercel.com/)

NextJS lets me create a statically rendered page with relative ease while using MDX to create Markdown files (like this one!) and then read them and convert to HTML which lets me quite easily create new blog posts or project pages.

Tailwind was used to style the project.

Vercel plugs neatly into NextJS which simplifies deploying the project.

## Features

- Static pages for a tidy user experience.
- I'm no designer but I am pretty happy with the styling.

## Challenges

Overall this stack was quite easy to work with. Converting MDX to HTML might be the hardest part and even that was quite simple. There is room to improve my implementation however.

## Future Improvements

- FIx some styling for the MDX files.
- Potentially fully responsive design.
- Keep adding new projects and blog posts, maybe use something else to not have to push posts and project-pages to this repo. Git submodules?
- Maybe plug in a proper backend and database at some point, though I see no reason for this at the moment.
